For this milestone, I plan on doing a text based choose your own adventure. It takes the choices from the user and guides
them through an epic adventure! I already have most of one branch done in the text file I uploaded. I am very excited to 
write the code for this. I have not started yet, but I plan on creating a recursive function that takes the string input of 
the user and goes along the path with the two choices they have until it reaches the end of the story. I don't plan on making 
it a very long story, but I already have so many ideas that I could build from this. For now, I want to keep writing the story
line.
