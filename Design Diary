For this milestone, I plan on doing a text based choose your own adventure. It takes the choices from the user and guides
them through an epic adventure! I already have most of one branch done in the text file I uploaded. I am very excited to 
write the code for this. I have not started yet, but I plan on creating a recursive function that takes the string input of 
the user and goes along the path with the two choices they have until it reaches the end of the story. I don't plan on making 
it a very long story, but I already have so many ideas that I could build from this. For now, I want to keep writing the story
line.

In all honesty, with everything that has been going on i have been wuite depressed. My season was cancelled and a lot of my motivation
to do my work has dimished a lot. I honestly put this on the back burner until this point and realized I still had to finish this 
milestone. I am finishing up the story right now, and then I will get into writing the code. I did not manage my time
well for this at all. I am actually quite ashamed of myself because I had so much time to complete this. Hopefully I can get this done 
before you grade this, which I think is probable for me. This whole second semester has just been very unmotivating. I am sorry
I keep letting my emotions get the better of me, I am usually much better than this.
Update:

I am struggling making the binary node tree in C#, mainly in unity. I am not sure how to go about it. I am definitely going to ask during
lab. I have an idea of how to do the logic for the choices in unity, and that mainly involves buttons that lead to the next in the search 
tree. But I just need help creating the search tree. I am not sure where to star/convert from C++.
