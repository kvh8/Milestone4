Choose Your Adventure!
Scholar:
	You are a scholar that has been studying the art of magic. You
	have made a breakthrough that could change humanity
	and has led you to your current situation. Will you
	stay in your tower and continue your studies? Or, will
	you journey to the Capital to present your work?
	Choose: Stay? or Journey?

	STAY: 	You decide to keep your work wo yourself and continue to 
		study it. Unfortunately, one of your potions exploded
		in your face, causing immense pain and partial blindness.
		You scury to find a neutralizing potion; hopefully the one
		you choose is the correct one. Do you pick up the blue or
		purple bottle?
		Choose: Blue Bottle? or Purple Bottle?
	
		BLUE: 	Ahhh, now that feels better. The blue bottle 
			neutralizes the effects and you can see again.
			However, you start to feel really tingly in your
			limbs. Checking the label, you realize you chose the 
			transfromation potion! Oh no! You double over in pain,
			your limbs extend and turn a scaly green, your eyes 
			become slitted, and you begin to grow in size, destroying
			the work you studied hard to obtain.
			At the end of your transformation, you have become a dragon!
			Everything in your wizards tower has been destroyed, and now
			you can't even transform back to fix anything. You are now
			an angry green dragon whose lair is a destroyed wizard 
			tower. END
		PURPLE: Ugh, what a bitter taste! Wait, your throat is closing up!
			What is happening? You're choking! It looks like you chose
			a bottle of poison! Unfortuantly, you're blind and you can't 
			breathe anymore, there is no way you could find the antidote.
			You fall to the floor suffocating, and you die within the 
			hour. Your work will forever be lost to the ages. END

	JOURNEY: You decide to journey to the Capital to share your work with the
		 world. On your journey, you stumble into clearing where you find
		an adventurer fighting a gruesome monster. They seem very skilled,
		but the monster also looks very tough. It stands at least 7 feet 
		tall, with thick scales, and long claws! Do you help or move along?
		Choose: Help? or Move Along?

		HELP: You decide to help the poor adventurer, and just in the 
			knick of time! The adventurer is trapped under the 
			enormous claws of the beast! 
			"Hey Stupid!" You yell. The beast whips its head to stare
			at you. It looks like it's about to charge! Quick, what do
			use to defend yourself? Do you use the sturdy looking stick
			on the ground next to you? Or do you attempt to use the
			new magic you recently learned about from your studies?
			Choose: Stick? or Magic?

			STICK: The beast charges! You quickly pick up the stick and
				attempt to bash the beast with the stick, but that
				was stupid. The beast is obviously not going to be
				hurt by a stick. As soon as the stick hits the beast
				it breaks in two, leaving you defenseless. The monster
				uses its enormous claws to slash at you! In on swipe
				you are decapitated! Your last thought was "All my 
				work wasted trying to be a hero." END
		
			MAGIC: The beast charges! You quickly try to summon a flame
				to protect you, but your lack of practice and nerves
				causes you to summon an explosion instead! This 
				inadvertently saves your life because you are thrown
				back and the monsters face is serverely burned! This 
				gives the adventurer enough time to finish it off. He
				lunges at the beast with his sword and stabs it in the 
				heart, ending its life. 
				In the aftermath of the battle, you are still groggy 
				from the explosion. The adventurer runs to your side to
				help you up.
				"Thank you so much for coming to my aid! I don't know 
				what I would have done if you had not shown up! Please,
				let me return the favor by travelling with you to repay 
				this debt."

		MOVE ALONG: You decided to leave the adventurer to their fate and 
				continue on your journey. You eventually make it to
				Capital where all important discoveries are introduced
				and pattented. It is late at night when you arrive, but
				on your way to a tavern you make a turn into a sketchy
				alleyway. Two men in all balck with masks appear! They
				pull out knives and slowly walk toward you. You begin 
				turn back out of the alley, but all of a sudden there
				is immense pain in your side! You look down and see a 
				knife protruding from you and another man in all black
				standing behind you. You slowly start to lose 
				conciousness and fall to the floor. The last thing you
				hear before the world turns black is the voice of one
				of the men saying, "Now, what do we have hear? A scholar, 
				eh? Wonder if we'll get rich off his work? HAHAHA!" END
