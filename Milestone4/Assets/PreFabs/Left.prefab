  m_Text: "As you go down the left tunnel, it begins to get more narrow until you
    are shimmying your way through. As you go forward,\r it begins to get very cold,
    until you come across a small cavern with glowing crystals everywhere. Extinguishing
    the torch\r you can see everything around you with out it. You make your way
    over to one of the walls and notice these are not just\r any crystals, but they
    humm slightly with magic. You try to grab one but it is stuck in there. You continue
    looking at them\r until you find one that looks loose. You pull on it and with
    a grunt the releases from the wall causing you to fall on your back from the
    force. Suddenly, you hear a cracking sound and when you look at the floor there
    are large cracks around where\r you sit. Slowly, you begin to stadn but the cracks
    get bigger until the entire floor you stand on loos about ready to break \rat
    any moment. The floor is made of ice! Every move you make causes more cracking
    sounds until suddenly, the floor gives and \ryou are free falling into a black
    hole with no end in sight. You scream for your life and the crystal in your hand
    glows \rbrighter and amplifies the sound you make. However, that has no use to
    you and you make impact with the floor below. The \rimpact is too great, and
    you die splattered on the cave floor, thus ending you \"grand\" advanture. \nGame
    Over!!"
