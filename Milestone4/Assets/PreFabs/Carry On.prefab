  m_Text: "For some ungodly reason you decide to continue on you journey, but it
    looks like you\r have hit a stroke of luck! You have found a trail with a marker
    that points in the direction \rof the Capital! You follow this trail all the
    way and never stop. By the time you get there\r it is midday. You make your way
    to the Scholar headquarters to present your work. When you\r walk into the building,
    you are amazed by all the people there with their inventions. It is\r intimidating
    to be around all these smart people. You make your way to the front desk and
    \rtell the clerk, that you have made a discovery. She hands you some paperwork
    to fill out, and\r before you know it, you are standing before the Scholar Council.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Scholars,\"
    you say. \"I have come before you today, to show my years of research have payed\r
    off. The ancient magics that we have heard of in stories are real! Let me demonstrate.\"
    \rYou focus into yourself, and bring forth the flame you were longing for not
    a dat ago. And \rthere in your palm, a small flame errupts. You hold your hand
    out expectantly, waiting for\r the Council's reaction. \n\n\rSlowly, laughter
    builds in the room, until everyone is full on belly laughing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Are\"
    gasp \"You serious?\" on of the council members says. \"We have known about the
    existance\r of magic for over 10 years now. It is in every textbook across the
    nation!\" He continues to \rlaugh. \"What rock have you been living under?!\"
    \n\nLaughter ensues, and you slowly make your way out of the building. You make
    your way to a bridge that is over a roaring river. You get onto ledge, and with
    a cry of agony you throw yourself off the bridge and are carried away, never\r
    to be seen again. \nGame Over!!\n"
