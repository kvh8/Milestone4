  m_Text: "You decide to make camp. You set up a little fire pit and put your\r sleeping
    rags next to the fire. Hopefully the fire will ward off any predators that might
    be lurking in the shadows. You eat some jerky that\r you packed for the journey
    and head to sleep. Hopefully you will be able to\r find your way in the morning.
    \r Oh no! Something has woken you up in the middle of the night. The fire has
    died\r down, but you begin to here a slight russle in the bushes around you.\r
    \n\n\"Hello?\" you call out, but there is no answer. Another rustle comes  from
    behind you.\r You turn but see nothing. Then something slices the back of your
    calf from behind!\r You turn and see a scaly tail disappear into the bushes.
    A few minutes pass and you\r begin to feel light headed. All of a sudden you
    collapse! You can no longer move!\r The animal has paralyzed you! You hear a
    rustle from behind you and a weird mixture\r of a hiss and growl. It slowly approaches
    from behind. The animal appears above your \r head, all scaly with razor sharp
    teeth. It looks down at you before striking your throat,\r ending your puny little
    life. \nGAME OVER!"
